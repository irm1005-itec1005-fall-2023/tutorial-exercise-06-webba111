## Description

The goal of this tutorial is for students to gain mastery level experience using `Flexbox`, a `CSS` tool that helps us layout elements on our pages.

## Instructions

You must have completed `Tutorial 05` before attempted this exercise. Completing this challenge will be very difficult without a solid understanding of the previous tutorials. The instructions below assume you have a working developer environment.

To complete this tutorial you must follow the steps below. Additional help can be found further below.

- There are two files that you are going to modify in this exercise, `style.css` and `index.html`.
- Using the final solution screenshots as a reference, you'll need to add `div`s and classes to your `HTML` and then add the styles for the various elements. Some content has been provided in the `index.html` file, but feel free to move it around or change it as you need.
- Use the hint below on how to structure the flexbox containers.
- If you get stuck, you can use the example in the `solutions` folder for guidance.
- Preview your pages using the LivePreview or LiveServer extentions in VSCode.
- Commit your changes and push to GitHub.
- Turn on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/orgs/irm1005-itec1005-fall-2023/discussions/4) in the `settings` section of your repository.
- View your live web pages.
- In the [Tutorial 06 - Show and Tell discussion](https://github.com/orgs/irm1005-itec1005-fall-2023/discussions/11) in our GitHub Discussion Group, add a comment with a link to your Search Page.
